Bulrush
=======

A [Bulma][1]-based [Pelican][2] blog theme; clean, flexible and responsive.

 ![Screenshot - Bulrush at 1440px][13]

The icons are from [Font Awesome][3] by Dave Gandy. The pure HTML/CSS "Fork me
on GitHub" ribbon is based on [`github-fork-ribbon-css`][4] by Simon Whitaker; I
modified it to be flatter.

Features
--------

 - [x] **Responsive design** - four column layout on desktop (≥980px), three column
on tablet (≥769px), single column on mobile. Tabbed navigation bar collapses
into drop-down "burger menu" on mobile.

 - [x] **Meta tagging functionality** - support for [Open Graph][5] and [Twitter
Cards][6] meta tags, giving enhanced display when sharing articles on social
media sites (**note**: *currently only available for [articles and pages][7]*).

 - [x] **Printable layouts** - the navigation is hidden when printed, avoiding
wasted space.

 - [x] **Custom styling** - additional CSS files can be included to customise
the default styling.

 - [x] **Service integrations** - including Disqus, GitHub, Google Analytics
and MailChimp.

Settings
--------

As well as the [basic settings][14], Bulrush supports the following options in
your `pelicanconf.py`:

| Setting name | What does it do? |
| --- | --- |
| `DISQUS_SITENAME` | Enables Disqus comments. Note that you should set up the full Comment Count Link, as no additional text is applied. |
| `GITHUB_URL` | Enables the "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon. |
| `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` | Set to `‘UA-XXXX-YYYY’` to activate Google Analytics. |
| `LINKS` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` for links to appear in the "blogroll" section of the sidebar. |
| `MAILCHIMP` | Configure to activate a [MailChimp][20] sign-up form; see details below. |
| `MENUITEMS` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` for items to appear in the tabbed navigation. |
| `SITESUBTITLE` | A subtitle to appear in the header. |
| `SOCIAL` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` to appear in the "social" section of the sidebar. |
| `TWITTER_USERNAME` | Enables Twitter meta-tags in the article and page headers. |

If `DISPLAY_CATEGORIES_ON_MENU` is omitted or set explicitly to `True`, the
categories are shown in the tabbed navigation with any `MENUITEMS`. If
`DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU` is omitted or set explicitly to `True`, they are listed
in the sidebar with any `SOCIAL` or other `LINKS`.

### Social Links

Appropriate icons are provided in the sidebar for a range of sites in the
`SOCIAL` link list. Have a look in [`social.html`][17] to see which titles this
applies to.

### MailChimp Configuration

If you're using [MailChimp][20] to handle a mailing list for your blog, you
can configure a subscription form in the sidebar. You need to set three values
to enable this, which you can get from [the signup form creator][21]. Simply
look for the form action:

```html
<form action="//user.region.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=abc123&amp;id=def456" ...
```

and extract the relevant sections:

```python
MAILCHIMP = dict(
    domain='user.region.list-manage.com',
    user_id='abc123',
    list_id='def456',
)
```

You can also add `rewards_url`, providing your unique [MonkeyRewards][19] URL,
to enable a *"Powered by MailChimp"* link.

Custom Styling
--------------

If any of the entries in `EXTRA_PATH_METADATA` have `'path'`s ending with
`'.css'` they will be included in the base template, allowing the site style
to be overridden as required. For example, in your `pelicanconf.py`:

```python
# Static files
STATIC_PATHS = [
    'extra',
    ...
]
EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
    'extra/custom.css': {'path': 'custom.css'},
    ...
}
```

Requirements
------------

This theme requires an additional Python dependency, [`webassets`][9], which can
be added to your project with:

```bash
pip install webassets
```

The main stylesheet is provided in [Less][16] format, so you will need the Less
compiler (`lessc`). An easy way to install this is:

```bash
npm install -g less
```

You also need to make the appropriate Pelican plugin, [`assets`][15], available.
One way of achieving this is to make the `pelican-plugin` repository a submodule
of your site, then you can add to your `pelicanconf.py`:

```python
PLUGIN_PATHS = ['pelican-plugins']
PLUGINS = ['assets']
```

It also requires two Jinja plugins, `webassets` and [the `with` statement][8].
To implement this, I have the following in my `pelicanconf.py`:

```python
JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {
    'extensions': ['webassets.ext.jinja2.AssetsExtension', 'jinja2.ext.with_'],
}
```
